"""Bookkeeping for Python: accounting, OFX, taxes

The **luca** command lets you manage your finances
using the same tools you use to manage the rest of your life:
plain-text files, version control, and the command line.

The name is pronounced *lew-cha* because it is Italian.
The tool is named for Luca Pacioli,
the Franciscan friar credited with the invention
of double-entry bookkeeping.
