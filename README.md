 Luca: Keeping my tax forms under version control
==================================================

As an independent consultant,
I sustain a very simple business structure:
an S-Corporation of which I am the sole employee.
In the ``luca`` command line tool,
I am slowly collecting commands and scripts
that help me automate the production
of business tax forms and other obligations
that my business must meet each quarter.

Luca is prounounced “Lew-cha” and is named after Luca Pacioli,
the Italian friend of Leonardo's who invented modern accounting.

Luca is not yet on the Python Package Index,
but can be installed directly from GitHub:

    git checkout https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/luca.git
    pip install luca/

You can find its documentation at Read The Docs:
