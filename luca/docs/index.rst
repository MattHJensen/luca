   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Luca's documentation!
================================

As an independent consultant,
I sustain a very simple business structure:
an S-Corporation of which I am the sole employee.
In the ``luca`` command line tool,
I am slowly collecting commands and scripts
that help me automate the production
of business tax forms and other obligations
that my business must meet each quarter.

Luca is prounounced “Lew-cha” and is named after Luca Pacioli,
the Italian friend of Leonardo's who invented modern accounting.

You can find the source code itself at:

    `Luca project on GitHub <https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/luca>`_

Installation instructions are also maintained there.
